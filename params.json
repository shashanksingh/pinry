{"name":"Pinry","body":"![Pinry Screenshot](https://github.com/overshard/pinry/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nBecause I don't like sharing. I would use these services to store a lot of\r\nimages and data that isn't necessarily personal but that I don't actually want\r\nto share or deal with the possibility of having it taken down by a DMCA notice.\r\nMy use of Pinterest/Wookmark boils down to having personal board for things I\r\nwant to remember or keep for inspiration.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\n\r\nSome features that I want to impelement, if you know how to implement them then\r\nplease do them for me! I'm very pull-request friendly and will not yell at you\r\nfor bad code, I'll simply work with you to improve it.\r\n\r\n + Add non-image URL support, take \"screenshot\" of page as a thumbnail.\r\n + Create a bookmarklet for quick saving.\r\n + Manual and automatic tagging via description, image alt tags and whatever else I can scrape.\r\n + Statistics page with graphs for image views, what times of day have the most posts, etc.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nHave virtualenv and pip installed. You may also need to have the build\r\ndependencies for PIL installed. (If you are on Ubuntu you can do this by typing\r\n\"sudo build-dep python-imaging\".)\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/overshard/pinry.git\r\n    $ cd pinry\r\n    $ virtualenv .\r\n    $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    $ bin/python manage.py syncdb\r\n    $ bin/python manage.py migrate\r\n    $ bin/python manage.py runserver\r\n\r\nFollowing this will get you a development server up and running. If you want a\r\nproduction server [Google around][2] for more information on running Django in a\r\nproduction environment and create a \"pinry/settings/production.py\" file.\r\n\r\n[0]: http://pinterest.com/\r\n[1]: http://www.wookmark.com/\r\n[2]: https://www.google.com/search?q=deploy+django+production\r\n","tagline":"Pinry is a self-hostable Pinterest \"clone\" that has a strong resemblance to Wookmark.
